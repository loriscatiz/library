# Library Management System Database

This repository contains the database schema for a Library Management System, showcasing strong database design and SQL skills. The schema is designed for efficient data management and scalability.

## Overview

The database manages key entities in a library system, such as:
- **Members**: Library patrons, including their account and activity details.
- **Books**: Information about books, their authors, and categories.
- **Borrowing and Reservations**: Tracks borrowed books and reservations made by members.
- **Fines**: Records issued fines for overdue returns or other infractions.
- **Staff**: Manages library staff accounts and roles.

## File Details

- **schema.sql**: Contains the complete database schema with table definitions, relationships, indexes, and constraints.

## Usage

To use the database schema:
1. Import the `schema.sql` file into your preferred SQL editor or tool (e.g., DBeaver, MySQL Workbench).
2. Execute the script to create the database and all associated tables.

This schema is a foundational component of a library management system and can serve as a starting point for further development, such as adding backend APIs or a frontend interface.
